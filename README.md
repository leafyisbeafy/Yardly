# Yardly: Hyperlocal Marketplace

Yardly isn't just another marketplace.

Yardly ditches the standard "radius" search. Users filter by specific neighborhood "corners" 

Facebook Marketplace is not solving the problem; Craigslist is full of odd individuals. There are niche apps for subleasing and pet adoption, but I don’t think people want to keep dozens of apps on their phones.

It pains me to see people trapped in the cycle of subleasing for rooms and cars. Even if they want to transfer deposits and pay rent, they struggle to find someone.

Students cannot make money from their used textbooks

A student who kept pests is now unable to care for them and is trying to find someone who can take them in, but is struggling to find the right person.

I’m giving it a shot to fix the problems I see every other day.

### Future Roadmap
* Integrate backend services (e.g., Firebase) for user auth and database.
